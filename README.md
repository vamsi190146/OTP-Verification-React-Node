## Overview

The OTP Verification System is a full-stack application built using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. This system allows users to receive a One-Time Password (OTP) via email and verify it to proceed with various operations.

### Key Features

- **OTP Generation and Sending**: Users can request an OTP to be sent to their email address.
- **OTP Verification**: Users can enter the OTP they received to verify their identity.
- **Responsive Design**: The frontend is designed with Bootstrap to ensure a responsive and user-friendly experience.
- **Backend Integration**: Node.js handles the server-side logic and email functionality.
